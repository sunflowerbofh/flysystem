php-league-flysystem for Debian
-------------------------------

This package is built with gbp and uscan.

We're using upstream's git tags rather than their tarballs, because they exclude
test-related files in their releases.

Steps to upgrade to a new upstream version:

    gbp import-orig --uscan
